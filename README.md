# MemoryGame
A Udacity Project to practise HTML, CSS and Javascript.
This is just a simple memory game with 16 tiles.
The game shows a star rating according to the moves a user needs to finish the game.
It also shows the time the user needs to finish the game.
When the user finishes, a modal shows the needed time and moves and tells the user what picture probably shows a look-alike of the user.
